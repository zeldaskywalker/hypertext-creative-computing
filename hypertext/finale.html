    <p>
        although the final version of the zine is polished, i find it really special to let y'all in on the chaos behind the scenes. <b>BEHOLD: MY RAW, MESSY, IMPERFECT WRITING!!!</b> despite being a self-professed lover of to-do lists, because they really do help me disentangle the madness that is my mind, i don't always return to them in their written form... as you can tell by none of the items being checked off.
